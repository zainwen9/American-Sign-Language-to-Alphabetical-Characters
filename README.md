# Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer
This project is a sign language alphabet recognizer using Python, openCV and a convolutional neural network model for classification. 
The goal of this project is to build a neural network which can identify the alphabet of the American Sign Language (ASL) through video input or images and translate it into text.

## Dataset
The primary source of data for this project was the compiled dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/american-sign-language-dataset).
The dataset is comprised of 18,200 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 26 total classes, each with 700 images, 26 for the
letters A-Z.

## Features
Our model was able to predict the 44 characters in the ASL with a prediction accuracy >95%.

Features that can be added:
* Deploy the project on cloud and create an API for using it.
* Increase the vocabulary of our model.
* Incorporate feedback mechanism to make the model more robust.
* Add more sign languages.

## Status
Project is: _finished_. was developed as a 6th semester final project for artificial neural networks.
